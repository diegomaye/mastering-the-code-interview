 Google Interview Preparation Algorithms
 
 Overview
 Aim of this document is to centralize all algorithms I have been developed to prepare for Google Interview, I use recomended Project Euler + Carrer cup + Hacker Rank, best so far Hacker Rank as best interface, but Project Euler are more related with math (important topic in Google Interviewes) + Carrer Cup has examples of Google interviews:
 
 https://projecteuler.net/
 https://careercup.com/
 https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard
 
 I focus my preparation on Java since is my main code language, but for example Project Euler & Carrer Cup have no code language specific but pure algorithm, hackerrank allows you to choose your favorite code language.
 
About courses I take basically 2 courses, I had just 3 weeks since you can imagine I passed most of classes, take in account I have been studing and teaching coputer science + I have ~15 years of experience in desgining and developing software, so I use them just like a review:
