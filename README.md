# Overview
 Aim of this repo is to share documentation and code with all those who are preparing a code interview, I would also like to share a bit of my experience being interviewed and interviewing candidates. The repo centralize all the algorithms that I have collected and developed to train myself, for fun or to interview new candidates. Some part of the repo are excersises of the book "Craking the Code Interview" and there are several Google/Amazon/Microsoft code example recommendations. There are multiple projects and repositories like: Project Euler + Carrer cup + Hacker Rank (recommended by Google/Amazon/Microsoft), as a recommendation for those who are starting out, the best one is Hacker Rank & Leet Code as they both have an easy to use interface, Project Euler is more math related and has more puzzles (more complex algorithms) + Carrer Cup has multiple interview examples. Geeks for geeks is an incredible encyclopaedia to delve into the implementation of algorithms.

 Most algorithms are focuse on Java since is my main language, Project Euler & Carrer Cup sites have not specific code language, hackerrank allows you to choose your favorite code language.
 
About courses for those that are starting in industry I strongly recommend 2 courses:
